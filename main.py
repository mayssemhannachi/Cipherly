        Caesar Cipher 
        <br>
        Step into the ancient world of Julius 
        Caesar, who invented one of the 
        earliest forms of encryption to keep 
        his military strategies under wraps. 
        The Caesar Cipher is a substitution 
        cipher that shifts each letter 
        in the alphabet by a certain number
        of positions. Want to send a secret 
        message like a Roman general?
        Just pick your shift value, 
        and Cipherly will do the rest‚Äî
        turning your plain text into a string 
        of cryptic letters! 
        Can you crack the code?
